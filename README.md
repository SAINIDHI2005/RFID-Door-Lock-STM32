# RFID-Door-Lock-STM32
🔐 RFID-Based Door Lock System using STM32 Nucleo F446RE
This project implements a simple RFID-based access control system using the STM32 Nucleo-F446RE, RC522 RFID reader, 16×2 LCD display, and an SG90 servo motor. The entire prototype is built on a breadboard and uses SPI, PWM, and GPIO peripherals available on the STM32.

The system continuously scans for RFID cards, verifies them, and controls a servo-based door lock mechanism based on authentication results.

📦 Hardware Used

STM32 Nucleo-F446RE

RC522 RFID Reader (MFRC522)

SG90 Servo Motor

16×2 LCD (4-bit mode)

Breadboard, jumper wires, power supply

⚙️ How the System Works

The MFRC522 RFID module is initialized over SPI.

Inside the main loop, the RFID status is polled continuously using:

MFRC522_Request()

MFRC522_Anticoll()

When an RFID tag or card is detected:

The card UID is read.

UID is compared against a list of allowed UIDs.

Based on authentication:

Valid UID

LCD displays ACCESS GRANTED for 3 seconds

Servo rotates from 0° to 180° (unlock position)

After 3 seconds, LCD shows DOOR LOCKED

Servo rotates back to 0° (locked position)

Invalid UID

LCD displays ACCESS DENIED for 3 seconds

LCD then returns to DOOR LOCKED

🧰 Software & Libraries

This project uses:

STM32 HAL drivers

RC522.h and related driver files

lcd.h and LCD driver

Standard C libraries (string.h, stdint.h, etc.)

PWM is generated using TIM2–Channel 1 for controlling the servo.
LCD is operated in 4-bit mode using GPIO pins.
UART (USART2) is optionally used for debugging UID values.
